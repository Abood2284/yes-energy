This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`c3`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/c3).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Cloudflare integration

Besides the `dev` script mentioned above `c3` has added a few extra scripts that allow you to integrate the application with the [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) environment, these are:

- `pages:build` to build the application for Pages using the [`@cloudflare/next-on-pages`](https://github.com/cloudflare/next-on-pages) CLI
- `preview` to locally preview your Pages application using the [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) CLI
- `deploy` to deploy your Pages application using the [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) CLI

> **Note:** while the `dev` script is optimal for local development you should preview your Pages application as well (periodically or before deployments) in order to make sure that it can properly work in the Pages environment (for more details see the [`@cloudflare/next-on-pages` recommended workflow](https://github.com/cloudflare/next-on-pages/blob/main/internal-packages/next-dev/README.md#recommended-development-workflow))

### Bindings

Cloudflare [Bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/bindings/) are what allows you to interact with resources available in the Cloudflare Platform.

You can use bindings during development, when previewing locally your application and of course in the deployed application:

- To use bindings in dev mode you need to define them in the `next.config.js` file under `setupDevBindings`, this mode uses the `next-dev` `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` submodule. For more details see its [documentation](https://github.com/cloudflare/next-on-pages/blob/05b6256/internal-packages/next-dev/README.md).

- To use bindings in the preview mode you need to add them to the `pages:preview` script accordingly to the `wrangler pages dev` command. For more details see its [documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev-1) or the [Pages Bindings documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/bindings/).

- To use bindings in the deployed application you will need to configure them in the Cloudflare [dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/). For more details see the [Pages Bindings documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/bindings/).

#### KV Example

`c3` has added for you an example showing how you can use a KV binding.

In order to enable the example:

- Search for javascript/typescript lines containing the following comment:
  ```ts
  // KV Example:
  ```
  and uncomment the commented lines below it.
- Do the same in the `wrangler.toml` file, where
  the comment is:
  ```
  #Â KV Example:
  ```
- If you're using TypeScript run the `cf-typegen` script to update the `env.d.ts` file:
  ```bash
  npm run cf-typegen
  # or
  yarn cf-typegen
  # or
  pnpm cf-typegen
  # or
  bun cf-typegen
  ```

After doing this you can run the `dev` or `preview` script and visit the `/api/hello` route to see the example in action.

Finally, if you also want to see the example work in the deployed application make sure to add a `MY_KV_NAMESPACE` binding to your Pages application in its [dashboard kv bindings settings section](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/pages/view/:pages-project/settings/functions#kv_namespace_bindings_section). After having configured it make sure to re-deploy your application.

You're absolutely right. In a production environment, it's more common and efficient for clients to have their forecast data in a database rather than static CSV files. This approach allows for easier updates, better data management, and more efficient querying. Let's restructure your project to accommodate this future scenario while maintaining flexibility.
Here's a proposed structure that would make it easier to integrate with a client's database in the future:

Create an API Layer:
Instead of directly processing CSV files, create an API that abstracts the data source. This API could initially work with your CSV files but can be easily modified to connect to a database in the future.
Use a Data Access Layer:
Implement a data access layer that separates the logic of data retrieval from the rest of your application. This layer can be swapped out or modified when transitioning from CSV to a database.
Implement a Webhook System:
Instead of uploading files, set up a webhook system that allows the client's system to push new or updated forecast data to your application.

Here's how we can modify your Cloudflare Worker to implement this structure:
Cloudflare Worker with Flexible Data SourceClick to open code
This new structure provides several advantages:

Abstraction: The ForecastDataAccess class abstracts the data source. Currently, it works with CSV files in R2, but it can be easily modified to work with a database in the future.
API Endpoints: Instead of directly processing files, we now have API endpoints that clients can use to fetch forecast data.
Webhook: We've added a webhook endpoint that allows for pushing forecast updates. This can be used by the client's system to automatically update the forecast data without manual CSV uploads.
Flexibility: This structure allows for easy transition from CSV files to a database. When the client is ready to switch to a database, you'll only need to modify the ForecastDataAccess class to connect to and query the new data source.

To use this new structure:

Update your src/index.ts file with this new code.
Deploy your updated Worker:
Copynpx wrangler deploy

Update your frontend application to use the new API endpoints for fetching forecast data.
When the client is ready to transition to a database:

Modify the getForecastData method in ForecastDataAccess to query the client's database instead of reading from CSV.
Update the storeForecastData method to insert data into the client's database.
Implement authentication and authorization for the webhook to ensure secure data updates.

This structure provides a clear path for future integration with a client's database while allowing you to continue working with CSV files in the short term. It also provides a standardized way for the client's system to push updates to your application, making the transition smoother when the time comes.
