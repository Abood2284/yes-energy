# Project Summary: Forecast Data Processing System

## Context

We're working on a system that processes forecast data, including both baseline and historical forecasts. The project uses NextJS with TypeScript, Cloudflare D1 for database, and Drizzle ORM for database queries.

## Key Changes Made

1. Data Structure:
   - Updated `ForecastData` interface to use separate `date` and `time` fields instead of a combined `datetime`.
   - Date format: "YYYYMMDD", Time format: "H" or "HH".
2. Database Queries:
   - Modified queries in `fetchBaselineForecasts` and `fetchHistoricalForecasts` to handle the new data structure.
   - Implemented string manipulation in SQL for parsing revision dates in historical forecasts.
3. Data Processing:
   - Updated `processForecasts` function to correctly parse separate date and time fields.
   - Modified `combineForecasts` function to use composite key (`${date}-${time}`) for merging baseline and historical data.
4. Error Handling:
   - Implemented more robust error logging in data processing functions.
   - Added try-catch blocks for date parsing to identify problematic data entries.

## Current Issues

1. "Invalid time value" errors were occurring in the `processForecasts` function.
2. Historical forecast query was returning 0 results, potentially due to incorrect date/time comparisons.

## Future Plans

1. Thoroughly test the updated functions with real data to ensure correct parsing and processing.
2. Optimize query performance, especially for historical data fetching.
3. Implement more comprehensive error handling and data validation throughout the system.
4. Consider adding indexes to database tables if query performance becomes an issue.
5. Implement the historical forecast feature in the frontend, ensuring proper display and interaction.

## Important Notes

- The system deals with forecast data from multiple sources (d_load_fcst, j_load_fcst, mm_load_fcst, mw_load_fcst).
- Historical forecast data is stored with revision information, requiring careful parsing and comparison.
- All date/time operations should consider potential timezone issues; UTC is used for consistency.
- The project requires maintaining TypeScript type safety throughout all modifications.
- Modifcaiton of code will only take place after through brainstorming and disucssion with the user. 


## Next Steps

1. Verify that all recent changes are correctly implemented across the codebase.
2. Run comprehensive tests on the updated system, particularly focusing on date/time parsing and historical data retrieval.
3. Begin implementation of frontend features to display and interact with historical forecast data.
   Remember: The key to this project is maintaining data integrity while efficiently processing and combining different types of forecast data. Always consider the specific format of date/time fields and the structure of the `ForecastData` interface when making changes.
